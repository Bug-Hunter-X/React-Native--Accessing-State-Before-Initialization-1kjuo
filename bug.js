This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object before the object has been fully initialized or rendered.  This often happens when using asynchronous operations like fetching data from an API or when dealing with lifecycle methods in React Native components.  For example, you might try to access `this.state.data` before `this.state` has been populated.

```javascript
// Incorrect Code
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      data: null,
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => this.setState({ data }));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>{this.state.data.name}</Text> {/* Error here if data is null */}
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```
